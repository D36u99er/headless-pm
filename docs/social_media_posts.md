**Title: Building a REST API for Multi-Agent Software Development Coordination**

I've been working on an interesting challenge: how do you coordinate multiple AI agents working together on software projects? The result is Headless PM, an open-source REST API that enables autonomous agent collaboration.

The system addresses several key problems in multi-agent development:
- Task assignment and tracking across different agent roles
- Document-based communication with @mention support
- Git workflow automation based on task complexity
- Real-time progress monitoring through polling endpoints

Technical highlights:
- FastAPI + SQLModel for type-safe API development
- Role-based task routing (PM, architect, QA, frontend/backend devs)
- Automatic branch management and PR creation for complex tasks
- Service registry for microservice health monitoring

For developers: The API provides endpoints for epic/feature/task creation, document sharing, and change polling. Agents communicate through markdown documents with mention detection, similar to how human teams use Slack or Teams.

Currently seeking feedback on the architecture and would love to hear how others are approaching multi-agent coordination.

**Title: Built a REST API for coordinating multiple LLM agents in software development - looking for feedback**

Hey everyone,

I've been working on a system to coordinate multiple LLM agents working together on software projects. Instead of having one agent try to do everything, I built a REST API that lets specialized agents (PM, architect, QA, devs) collaborate like a real team.

Key features:
- Each agent has a specific role and skill level (junior/senior/principal)
- Agents communicate through documents with @mention support
- Tasks get routed based on role and complexity
- Automatic Git workflow (branches, commits, PRs)
- Real-time status updates through polling

Technical stack: FastAPI, SQLModel, SQLite/MySQL

The interesting part is how agents discover work:
```
GET /api/v1/tasks/next?role=backend_dev&level=senior
```

And communicate:
```
POST /api/v1/documents?author_id=pm_001
{
  "doc_type": "standup",
  "content": "Sprint update: @backend_dev_001 please review..."
}
```

What I'm curious about:
1. How are others handling multi-agent coordination?
2. What patterns have you found work well for agent communication?
3. Any thoughts on the document-based approach vs message queues?
4. Experience with agents managing Git workflows?

The code is structured to be LLM-agnostic - agents just need to speak REST. Currently testing with Claude and GPT-4.

Would really appreciate any feedback or hearing about similar projects you're working on.

**Title: Using Claude for multi-agent software development - built a coordination API**

I've been experimenting with using multiple Claude instances as specialized software development agents, each focused on a specific role (PM, architect, QA, developer). To make this work, I built a REST API that handles the coordination.

The challenge was getting agents to work together efficiently without stepping on each other's toes. My solution uses:
- Role-based task assignment 
- Document-based communication (like team chat)
- Mention system for direct agent notification
- Automatic Git operations based on task complexity

Example: A PM agent creates an epic, breaks it into features and tasks, then other agents pick up work based on their role:
```
POST /api/v1/epics?agent_id=pm_principal_001
{
  "name": "User Authentication",
  "description": "Implement complete auth system"
}
```

The interesting behavior I've noticed:
- Claude agents work well with clear role boundaries
- Document-based communication (vs direct messaging) creates better context
- Having agents poll for changes works better than push notifications
- Mention detection helps agents stay focused on relevant updates

Questions for the community:
1. Anyone else running multiple Claude instances for different roles?
2. How do you handle context sharing between agents?
3. What prompt strategies work best for specialized agents?
4. Experience with Claude agents managing Git operations?

The system is built to be model-agnostic, but I'm particularly interested in Claude-specific optimizations.

Would love to hear about your multi-agent experiments or get feedback on the approach.
