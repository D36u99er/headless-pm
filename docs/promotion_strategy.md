# Promotion Strategy for Headless PM

## Additional Platforms and Communities

### 1. Hacker News
**Strategy**: Focus on technical architecture and engineering decisions
- Post during peak hours (9-10 AM PST weekdays)
- Title: "Show HN: REST API for Coordinating Multiple AI Agents in Software Development"
- Emphasize the open-source nature and technical implementation details
- Be prepared to answer technical questions in comments

### 2. Discord Communities
**Recommended Servers**:
- **LangChain Discord** - Active community building LLM applications
- **AI Engineers Discord** - Focus on practical AI engineering
- **LocalLLaMA Discord** - Strong interest in multi-agent systems
- **Anthropic Discord** (if available) - Claude-specific implementations

**Approach**: Share in #projects or #show-and-tell channels, offer to do a demo

### 3. Twitter/X
**Strategy**: Thread format with visual architecture diagram
- Tag relevant accounts: @LangChainAI, @AnthropicAI, @FastAPI
- Use hashtags: #LLMOps, #AIAgents, #OpenSource
- Include a simple architecture diagram
- Break down key features across 4-5 tweets

### 4. Dev.to / Hashnode
**Article Series Approach**:
1. "Building Multi-Agent Systems: The Coordination Problem"
2. "REST API Design for AI Agent Communication"
3. "Implementing Role-Based Task Routing for LLM Agents"
4. "Git Automation for AI-Driven Development"

### 5. GitHub
**Optimization**:
- Add topics: `multi-agent`, `llm`, `ai-agents`, `fastapi`, `rest-api`
- Create detailed examples in `/examples` directory
- Add architecture diagrams to README
- Create GitHub Discussions for community feedback

### 6. YouTube/Loom
**Video Content**:
- 5-minute demo showing agents collaborating on a real task
- Architecture walkthrough
- Setup tutorial
- "Day in the life of an AI development team" showcase

### 7. Academic/Research Communities
- **arXiv**: Consider writing a short paper on the architecture
- **Papers with Code**: If you add benchmarks or evaluation metrics
- **AI Alignment Forum**: Focus on coordination and safety aspects

### 8. Specialized Forums
- **LessWrong**: Focus on rationality and coordination aspects
- **IndieHackers**: For the bootstrapped/startup angle
- **ProductHunt**: Schedule a launch for maximum visibility

### 9. Slack Communities
- **MLOps Community Slack**
- **Remote Python Slack**
- **FastAPI Slack**
- **AI Product Managers Slack**

### 10. Meetups and Conferences
**Lightning Talk Topics**:
- "Lessons from Building Multi-Agent Dev Teams"
- "REST vs Message Queues for Agent Communication"
- "Git Automation in the Age of AI"

**Target Events**:
- Local Python/AI meetups
- LLM meetups
- DevOps/MLOps conferences
- Open source conferences

## Content Strategy by Platform

### Technical Platforms (HN, Dev.to, GitHub)
- Deep technical details
- Architecture decisions and trade-offs
- Performance metrics
- Code examples

### Social Platforms (Twitter, LinkedIn)
- Visual content (diagrams, screenshots)
- Success stories
- Industry implications
- Thought leadership angle

### Community Platforms (Discord, Slack, Reddit)
- Ask for specific feedback
- Share work-in-progress updates
- Offer to help others with similar problems
- Build relationships before promoting

## Timing Recommendations

**Best Days**:
- Tuesday-Thursday for most platforms
- Sunday evening for Reddit
- Weekday mornings for LinkedIn

**Avoid**:
- Friday afternoons
- Major holidays
- During major tech events (unless relevant)
